"""
Problem 1:
You are planning a road trip and need to calculate the total distance you will travel.
You have three segments of your trip:
- The first segment is 120 miles.
- The second segment is 150 miles.
- The third segment is 200 miles.

Write a function called total_distance that takes three arguments, each representing the distance of a segment,
and returns the total distance of the trip.

Example:
total_distance(120, 150, 200) should return 470
"""


def total_distance(segment1, segment2, segment3):
    return segment1+segment2+segment3
#print(total_distance(120,150,200))


"""
Problem 2:
You want to evenly distribute 25 candies among 4 children. Write a function called distribute_candies that 
takes two arguments, the total number of candies and the number of children, and returns the number of candies each 
child will get and the number of leftover candies.

Example:
distribute_candies(25, 4) should return (6, 1)
"""

"""
Problem 3:
You are baking cookies and need to adjust the recipe based on the number of people you are serving. 
The original recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar and serves 4 people.
Write a function called adjust_recipe that takes two arguments, the number of cups of sugar in the original 
recipe and the number of people you are serving, and returns the adjusted amount of sugar needed.

Example:
adjust_recipe(2, 8) should return 4.0
"""

"""
Problem 4:
You are budgeting for a party and need to calculate the total cost. 
You have the following expenses:
- Food: $100
- Decorations: $50
- Entertainment: $75

Write a function called total_cost that takes three arguments, each representing an expense, 
and returns the total cost of the party.

Example:
total_cost(100, 50, 75) should return 225
"""


def total_cost(food_expense, decorations_expense, entertainment_expense):
    return food_expense+decorations_expense+entertainment_expense

"""
Problem 5:
You are managing a small business and need to calculate the profit. 
Your revenue is $1500 and your expenses are $1200.
Write a function called calculate_profit that takes two arguments, revenue and expenses, and returns the profit.

Example:
calculate_profit(1500, 1200) should return 300
"""
